# Covid-Chatbot

Here we have built a covid-19 chatbot
Defining about 6 intents we were able to train the chatbot.
NLTK was used in tokenizing and extracting necessary information.
Training was done over 1000 epochs, using the adam optimizer.
Flask is the web framework we opted to go with.
Html and CSS was used to design the user interface and it was made dynamic through the use of javascript.
